Box: Remove deprecated colors + update naming

What: Removing old colors from colors.module.css could potentially have outdated colors
Why: Cambio/old colors were overlapping + not all cambio box colors were selectable in background colors
How: Users should verify some of the outdated grayscale colors are updated to the new Cambio ones.
